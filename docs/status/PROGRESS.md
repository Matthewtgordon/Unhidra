### Technical Highlights

#### JWT Authentication Pattern

All authenticated endpoints now use the `AuthUser` extractor:

```rust
pub async fn create_channel(
    State(pool): State<PgPool>,
    crate::auth::AuthUser(user_id): crate::auth::AuthUser,  // Auto-validates JWT
    Json(req): Json<CreateChannelRequest>,
) -> Result<Json<ChannelResponse>, ApiError> {
    // user_id is now the authenticated user's ID from JWT
}
```

#### PostgreSQL Integration

Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production readiness:
- Connection pooling with configurable max connections
- Environment-based configuration
- Health checks in Docker Compose
- Integration test suite with isolated test database

#### Infrastructure Services

All core infrastructure now runs via Docker Compose:
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent data storage with migrations
- **Redis**: Caching and Redis Streams for event distribution
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for files
- **Mosquitto**: MQTT broker with WebSocket support for IoT devices

All audit logging uses a consistent pattern to avoid handler trait issues:

```rust
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let audit_event = AuditEvent::new(user_id, AuditAction::Login)
        .with_service("auth-api")
        .with_ip(ip_str)
        .with_resource("user", "user");
    let _ = audit::log(audit_event).await;
});
```

#### Coverage Summary

**Auth-API:**
- ✅ Login handlers (success/failure with reasons)
- ✅ Device management (register/revoke)
- ✅ SSO/OIDC (all providers)
- ✅ WebAuthn/Passkeys (register/auth/revoke)

**Chat-Service:**
- ✅ Channel operations (create/add members)
- ✅ Thread operations (messages/participants)
- ✅ File operations (upload/delete)

### Compliance Impact

This implementation provides comprehensive audit trails for:
